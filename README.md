# Chinese Postman Problem

## Introduction

Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) is a famous problem in graph theory. The problem is to find the shortest path that visits every edge of a graph at least once. The problem is also known as Route Inspection Problem, Arc Routing Problem, and Rural Postman Problem. The problem was first introduced by Chinese mathematician Kuan in 1962. The problem is NP-hard, which means that there is no known polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem. The problem is also known as the "Postman Problem" because it is similar to the problem faced by a postman who needs to deliver mail to every house in a neighborhood.
